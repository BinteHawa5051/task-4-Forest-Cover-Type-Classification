# Forest Cover Type Classification  

## Project Overview  
This project focuses on predicting the type of forest cover based on cartographic and environmental features from the Covertype (UCI) dataset. The problem is a multi-class classification task where each sample belongs to one of several forest cover types.  

The project demonstrates how to handle real-world data, apply different machine learning algorithms, and compare their performance.

## Workflow  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Cleaned and prepared the dataset.  
   - Handled categorical features and applied scaling.  
   - Split into training and testing sets.  

2. **Modeling**  
   - Implemented Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers.  
   - Evaluated models on accuracy and performance metrics.  

3. **Evaluation and Visualization**  
   - Generated and analyzed the confusion matrix.  
   - Plotted feature importance to interpret model decisions.

## Results  
- Both Random Forest and XGBoost achieved strong performance.  
- XGBoost generally outperformed Random Forest due to its boosting mechanism.  
- Visualizations provided insights into which features influenced classification the most.
